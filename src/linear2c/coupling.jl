#
# coupling.jl — Wigner–Eckart recoupling for matrix blocks (§4)
#
# Implements the `transform_λ` step that converts equivariant (coupled) features
# X^{λμ} into an (l,m;l',m') matrix block and back, using the real-spherical-
# harmonic Clebsch–Gordan coupling consistent with `EquivariantTensors.O3`.
#
# IMPORTANT — this is the *Clebsch–Gordan coupling of two independent orbital
# indices* (a tensor product), NOT the Gaunt/product coupling of two harmonics
# at the same point. The latter (`O3.coupling_coeffs` / `O3.cgmatrix`) carries
# the selection rule `l+l'+λ` even and would drop the odd-`l+l'+λ` channels. As
# a pure change of basis on the block, ALL admissible `λ ∈ |l-l'|:l+l'` are
# present. NOTE on terminology: the LCAO Hamiltonian of a scalar operator is a
# PROPER O(3) tensor (transforming as D^l ⊗ D^{l'}); the odd-`l+l'+λ` λ-blocks
# carry inversion sign (-1)^{l+l'}, which is simply the correct behaviour of
# that component of l⊗l' — they are not "pseudotensors of H". Whether an
# odd-`l+l'+λ` component is nonzero is a question of selection rules and the
# feature set that sources it (see §5.2 / the model files): for on-site and
# single-bond blocks the odd channels vanish identically (Gaunt rule / one bond
# vector), so they are unused there; they can be nonzero only for environment-
# dependent off-site blocks with genuine axial/chiral geometry, which the
# real-CG ACE features cannot form.
#
# Construction (verified numerically, see test_coupling.jl):
#   * Start from the COMPLEX CG block  Cc[μ,m,m'] = ⟨l m; l' m' | λ μ⟩  (all λ,
#     all parities nonzero), which intertwines  Dc^l X (Dc^{l'})ᵀ ↔ Dc^λ v.
#   * Map to the real basis via the vector law  v_real = Ctran(l) · v_complex
#     (verified: `D_from_angles(l,·,real) = Ctran(l) D_complex Ctran(l)'`), so a
#     covariant block converts as  X_r = T_l X_c T_{l'}ᵀ  with  T = Ctran.
#   * The resulting coupling is purely real on even-`l+l'+λ` channels and purely
#     imaginary on odd ones; since `D_from_angles(·,real)` is real, real and
#     imaginary parts intertwine separately. We take the real part on even
#     channels and the imaginary part on odd channels — a single real, complete,
#     orthonormal change of basis over all λ.
#
# Conventions: ascending indices, m = -l:l ↦ 1:2l+1, μ = -λ:λ ↦ 1:2λ+1; a block
# transforms as  X ↦ D^l(Q) X D^{l'}(Q)ᵀ  and a coupled component as v ↦ D^λ v,
# all with `O3.D_from_angles(·, real)`.
#
# This file currently lives in ACEoperators; it is a candidate for upstreaming
# into EquivariantTensors once stable (see agents/plan_lin2c.md §1.5).

    channel_parity(l, l', λ) -> Symbol

Classifies a coupled channel by `l+l'+λ`: `:even` channels are sourced by the
ordinary (geometric, proper-tensor) ACE/bond features; `:odd` channels would
require axial/chiral features (parity `(-1)^{λ+1}`) that the real-CG ACE
construction cannot form, and vanish identically for on-site and single-bond
blocks. The on-/off-site models populate the `:even` channels (§5.2).

(The names refer to the parity of `l+l'+λ`, not to the Hamiltonian itself, which
is a proper O(3) tensor — see the file header.)

    cg_block([T=Float64], l, l', λ) -> Array{T,3}

Dense real Clebsch–Gordan block coupling `C[μ+λ+1, m+l+1, m'+l'+1]` coupling the
orbital pair `(l, l')` to the output irrep `λ`, in the ascending-index real
convention consistent with `O3.D_from_angles(·, real)` (see file header). The
element type `T` selects the working precision of the stored coupling.

Returns a `(2λ+1, 2l+1, 2l'+1)` array; nonzero for every triangle-admissible
`λ ∈ |l-l'|:l+l'` (both parities). The slices are orthonormal:
`Σ_{m,m'} C[μ,m,m'] C[ν,m,m'] = δ_{μν}`.

The construction is carried out internally in `ComplexF64`; `T` only selects
the storage precision (a `T` wider than `Float64` gains no accuracy).
